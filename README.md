## Overview
This project aims to develop an interactive web application for assessing various financial risks beyond credit risk, including operational and other types. The application allows users to input financial parameters such as income, expenses, assets, liabilities, credit history, and other relevant factors. It utilizes machine learning models trained to predict different types of financial risks, providing users with comprehensive risk assessments. The tool aids financial institutions and individuals in making informed decisions regarding risk management and financial planning.

## Implementation
The application is implemented in Python using Streamlit for the web application, pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for machine learning tasks, and relevant libraries for data preprocessing and visualization. It is structured into user input forms, data preprocessing steps, and prediction functionality for estimating various financial risk probabilities dynamically.

## Insights
The application provides insights into different types of financial risk assessments, such as credit risk, operational risk, and others. Users gain understanding of the impact of various financial parameters on different types of risks, identify areas of concern, and receive actionable insights for risk mitigation strategies. It enables users to make informed decisions regarding risk management and financial planning based on the comprehensive risk assessments provided by the application.
